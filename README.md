# docker-basics

1. download and install vscode and Docker for Windows
2. enable WSL (Windows sub-system for Linux)
3. configure docker client to work from Linux (this requires one configuration change, we can go through this together)
4. register in dockerhub (docker.io)

-check for example this postgis database image https://hub.docker.com/r/mdillon/postgis

-postgis is an extension of postgres

5. Go through the following examples (in this repo):

-basic dockerfile (used to create your own docker image)

-docker compose (used to launch a set of pre-build images)

After these let's go through some Kubernetes examples.
